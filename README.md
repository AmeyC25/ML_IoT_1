I devised a Q4 Drone based Chinkara identification system using YOLO v3 algorithm. 
I learnt the intricate details about drone as well, and came up with a working code for identification of chinkara from the drone shot frames.
The details of the project can be seen in the PDf.

This is just a template for course project. The whole details of this were not added because of official restrictions.
